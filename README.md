# finger-drum-samulnori - JavaScript
Samulnori is playing four Korean traditional instruments together.
Finger Drum Samulnori app is designed for finger drumming pads. this is a prototype. basic pad sound.
Original audio sample from National Gugak Center South Korea(ÏùåÏõê Ï†úÍ≥µ: Íµ≠Î¶Ω Íµ≠ÏïÖÏõê) 
Couldn't upload .wav file I had to convert to .mp3 so the audio quality in less than what I expected.
version 2 will be better, I hope.

# Sanke Bite! My very best first classic game.
### about 40 years ago (1985...), I had a opprtunity to see a PC(IBM or apple) only one night. I open the book and there is a code for the Snake Bite game. I just follow the code and Voila! snake run!!
After 40 years I play Snake bite game again, the difference is tha I programmed it by myself.
I chased my dream for long time, but i did not realize tha I had a dream.
My dream came true because of modern technic and Internet.
If I can do this, anyone can.
