## ✨ I create awesome contents

# finger-drum-samulnori
Samulnori is playing four Korean traditional instruments together.
Finger Drum Samulnori app is designed for finger drumming pads. this is a prototype. basic pad sound.
Original audio sample from National Gugak Center South Korea(음원 제공: 국립 국악원) 
Couldn't upload .wav file I had to convert to .mp3 so the audio quality in less than what I expected.
version 2 will be better, I hope.
